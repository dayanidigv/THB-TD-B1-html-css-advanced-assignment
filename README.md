**Repo Description:**  
Hands-on practice for Advanced HTML & CSS. Each student works in their own branch and folder, completes every example, commits learnings, and submits via PR for review.

---

## Steps to Complete Assignment

1. **Get the PDF**
   - Use the provided `advanced-html-css-practice.pdf` for all examples.

2. **Clone the Repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dayanidigv/THB-TD-B1-html-css-advanced-assignment.git
cd THB-TD-B1-html-css-advanced-assignment
````

3. **Create Your Branch**

   * Use your **student ID** as the branch name:

```bash
git checkout -b <your-student-id>
```

4. **Create Your Personal Folder**

   * Inside `assignments/`, create a folder for yourself:

```bash
mkdir assignments/<your-name-or-id>
```

5. **Work on Examples**

   * Each example should have its **own folder** inside your personal folder:

```
assignments/<your-name-or-id>/
â”œâ”€â”€ 01-example-name/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ screenshot.png
â”œâ”€â”€ 02-example-name/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ form.html
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ screenshot.png
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

* Inside each example folder:

  * Add HTML/CSS files.
  * Modify and experiment with code.
  * Take a screenshot of the result.

6. **Commit Each Example**

   * After completing an example, commit with a **descriptive message** about what you learned:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Example 01: Practiced semantic HTML - headers, main, footer"
git push origin <your-student-id>
```

7. **Repeat for All Examples**

   * Continue the same process for every example.

8. **Submit for Review**

   * Once all examples are complete:

     * Go to your GitHub profile.
     * Create a **Pull Request** from your branch to `main`.
     * Wait for it to be reviewed and merged.

---

## Notes

* Always work on your branch; **do not push directly to `main`**.
* Keep folders and filenames clean and consistent.
* Experiment with the code â€” screenshots must reflect your changes.
* Commit **after each example** with clear learning points.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
